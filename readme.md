**At-a-Glance ðŸ‘€**

We aimed to experiment with adapting computational notebooks into VR and verify the potential benefits VR can bring. We focus on the navigation and comparison aspects as they are primitive components in analysts' workflows. To further improve comparison, we have designed and implemented a Branching & Merging functionality. We tested computational notebooks on the desktop and in VR, both with and without the added Branching & Merging capability. We found VR significantly facilitated navigation compared to desktop, and the ability to create branches enhanced comparison.

**Motivation ðŸ¤”**

As computational notebooks become more complex, navigating and comparing analytical workflows in traditional desktop environments presents significant challenges. Analysts often struggle with linear execution, inefficient navigation, and limited comparison capabilities.

**Solution ðŸ’¡ (Demo Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnA2PpYqMlA)**

We developed an immersive computational notebook that extends traditional desktop notebooks into VR, enabling enhanced navigation and comparison workflows. A key feature of our system is the Branch & Merge functionality, which allows users to create, explore, and compare multiple analysis paths more efficiently in an immersive environment.![vr+notebook]
